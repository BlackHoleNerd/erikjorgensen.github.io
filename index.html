    <h3>About Erik</h3>
    <p>
      I embraced the gift of autism, questioned what no scientist dared, and emerged with the truth.
      This is my legacy: a classical unified field theory of everything.

    <h3>What Is CGH Physics?</h3>

      CGH stands for the constants of nature—<strong>1/c</strong> (speed of light), <strong>2G</strong> (attraction of gravity), and <strong>ħ</strong> (quantum of action). I unify them into one ultimate classical field theory where all particles are rotating black holes, one-particle wavefunctions are physical fields, and the universe is a computable simulation.

    <h3>The Simulation</h3>
    <p>
      I am building a real-time Python simulation of the universe based on this theory. No Unity. No second quantization. Just reality, written in code.
