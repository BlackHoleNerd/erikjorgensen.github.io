    <h3>About Erik</h3>
    <p>
      I survived what no child should, questioned what no scientist dared, and emerged with the truth.
      This is my legacy: a unified, classical, deterministic theory of everything.

    <h3>What Is CGH Physics?</h3>
    <p>
      CGH stands for the constants of nature—<strong>C</strong> (speed of light), <strong>G</strong> (gravity), and <strong>ħ</strong> (quantum action). I unify them into one recursive classical field theory where particles are rotating black holes, wavefunctions are real fields, and the universe is a computable simulation.

    <h3>The Simulation</h3>
    <p>
      I am building a real-time Python simulation of the universe based on this theory. No Unity. No second quantization. Just reality, written in code.
