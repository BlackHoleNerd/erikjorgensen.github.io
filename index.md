Erik Jorgensen’s Science Cinematic Series

Welcome to my 32-part video series that explores the **origin, structure, and evolution of the universe** through the lens of **CGH physics** — a unified field theory combining relativity, gravity, and quantum mechanics.

Each episode builds a bridge between classical fields and modern science, guiding you from the **Big Bang** to the **Theory of Everything**.
